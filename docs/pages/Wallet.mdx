# Wallets in TON
Before you can send, receive, or interact with smart contracts on The Open Network (TON), you need a wallet. Think of it as your bank on the blockchain‚Äîwhere you store your TON coins, manage assets like NFTs, and sign transactions securely.

## Choosing The Right Wallet
TON offers different types of wallets, but for this tutorial, we‚Äôll be using Tonkeeper. It‚Äôs one of the most user-friendly wallets for managing TON assets, interacting with dApps, and making transactions seamlessly.

### Other popular TON wallets include:
- TON Wallets 
- Tonhub

## Setting Up Tonkeeper
1Ô∏è‚É£ Download & Install ‚Üí Get Tonkeeper from tonkeeper.com. <br/>
2Ô∏è‚É£ Create a Wallet ‚Üí Follow the setup process and secure your seed phrase. <br/>

## Switching to TON Testnet
To develop and test smart contracts without using real funds, you need to switch to the testnet:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Open Tonkeeper and go to Settings. <br/>
2Ô∏è‚É£ Scroll down and tap the Ton logo 5 times. <br/>
3Ô∏è‚É£ Find the Network option and switch from Mainnet to Testnet and create a new account. <br/>

For this tutorial, we'll be using the Google Chrome [Tonkeeper](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tonkeeper-%E2%80%94-wallet-for-to/omaabbefbmiijedngplfjmnooppbclkk) extension.

Now, your wallet is connected to TON Testnet, allowing you to use test tokens.

## Getting Test TON
To deploy and test contracts, you need to test TON coins. Follow these steps:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Open Telegram and start a chat with the TON Testnet Faucet [Bot](https://t.me/testgiver_ton_bot). <br/>
2Ô∏è‚É£ Click Start and follow the instructions. <br/>
3Ô∏è‚É£ Paste your Tonkeeper Testnet Wallet Address when prompted. <br/>
4Ô∏è‚É£ Wait a few seconds, and the bot will send you 2 test TON. <br/>

Once you receive your test TON, you're ready to build and deploy smart contracts on the TON Testnet! üöÄ
