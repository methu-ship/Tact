# Data Types and Operators in Tact

Tact is a **strongly typed** language designed for writing smart contracts on **TON**. Understanding its **data types** and **operators** is key to efficient contract development.

## Data Types in Tact

Tact supports **primitive** and **complex** data types:

### 🔹 Primitive Types
- `Int`, `Uint` → Signed & unsigned integers (For signed int,`let x: Int as int32= -5;` For unsigned int, `let x: Int as Uint32= 10;`)  
- `Bool` → Boolean values (`let isActive: Bool = true;`)  
- `Address` → TON address (`myAddress: Address = address("EQC2...yourTONAddress...");`)
- `Cell`, `Slice` → Used for storing and processing data.

:::tip
Be mindful of the data types and storage sizes you use, as larger sizes can lead to higher gas costs.

### 🔹 Complex Types
- `Tuple` → Fixed-size collection (`let myTuple: (Int, Bool) = (10, true);`)  
- `Map<K, V>` → Key-value storage (`let users: Map<Address, Int> = new Map();`)  
- `Array<T>` → Dynamic list (`let numbers: Array<Int> = [1, 2, 3];`)  
- `Struct` → Custom structures

## Operators in Tact

### 🔹 Arithmetic Operators
`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%` (e.g., `let sum = 5 + 3;`)  

### 🔹 Comparison Operators
`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=` (e.g., `let isEqual = (5 == 5);`)  

### 🔹 Logical Operators
`&&` (AND), `||` (OR), `!` (NOT)  

### 🔹 Assignment Operators
`=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`  

## Functions in Tact

1️⃣ Get Functions (Read-only) – Used for retrieving data without modifying state.

```ts
get fun getCounter(): Int {
    return self.counter;
}
```

2️⃣ Receive Functions (State-modifying) – Handle messages and update contract state.

```ts
receive(msg: Increment) {
    self.counter += msg.amount;
}
```
We’ve gone through the basics of Tact, but there’s always more to learn. If you want to get comfortable with the language, be sure to check out the [Tact documentation](https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/) or check [Tact-by-example](https://tact-by-example.org/00-hello-world).
