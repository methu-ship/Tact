# Environment Setup

Before we get started with writing smart contracts, we first need to set up our development environment. Think of this as preparing your workspace before building something greatâ€”itâ€™ll make everything smoother as we go along.

For this guide, we'll be using the blueprint development environment.

## Quick Start
To begin, you'll need a code editor (recommend VS Code) and Node.js installed on your system. If you havenâ€™t installed Node.js yet, you can get it from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

Open VS Code, launch the terminal, and run the following command:
```sh
npm create ton@latest

```
This command initializes a new project. Youâ€™ll be prompted to enter a nameâ€”choose something meaningful, like Ton-testing.

Next, youâ€™ll see an option to select a contract template. Choose Empty Tact Contract to start with a clean setup.

### Project Structure
After the setup is complete, your project folder should look like this:
```plaintext
Ton-testing/
â”œâ”€â”€ build/
|   â”œâ”€â”€ node_modules/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ contracts/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ counter.tact
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Scripts/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ test/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ logo.png
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```

### Next Steps
With your environment set up, youâ€™re now ready to start building smart contracts on TON.
