Now that we’ve got a solid grasp of Tact, it’s time to put that knowledge to work by creating a fungible token on TON. Just like Ethereum’s ERC-20 tokens, TON has its own standard for fungible tokens called Jettons.

In this guide, we’ll break down how Jettons work and walk through the steps to create one from scratch. By the end, you’ll have a fully functional token that you can deploy, transfer, and integrate into the TON ecosystem. Let’s get started!

## Understanding Jettons
In the TON ecosystem, fungible tokens don’t follow the ERC-20 standard like Ethereum. Instead, TON has its own approach—Jettons. Think of Jettons as the backbone of fungible assets on TON, enabling everything from in-app currencies to staking and governance tokens.

At their core, Jettons follow the TIP-3 standard, a flexible and efficient way to manage token balances while keeping the blockchain lightweight. Unlike Ethereum’s ERC-20, Jettons don’t store balances directly in the smart contract. Instead, each user has their own Jetton wallet, which holds their balance and interacts with the main contract.
